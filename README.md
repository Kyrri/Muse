FYPD - Museum Project Muse repo

**DO NOT commit the folder 'node_modules' if you make any changes. This folder is created when you install package dependencies.
To make sure you don't, before a commit, type 'git reset nodetest1/node_modules' (the path to the folder node_modules, that is) 
in your terminal from your source folder where the .git file is (probably called Muse)

To install/use:

1) Download and install Node.js. To do this on Mac, follow this guide up until, and including "Installing NPM".
  You'll end up with Node.js, and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. All these commands are run
  from your terminal, which is an app you can find in Utilities.

2) Navigate in your terminal to Muse/nodetest1, and from here type 'npm install'. This will install package dependencies defined
  in package.json 

3) To run the server, type "node app.js" from the terminal in your Muse/nodetest1 directory (if this fails, try "nodejs app.js")

4) To test server, in your browser, go to http://localhost:3000
